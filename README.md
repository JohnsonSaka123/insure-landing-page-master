## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript (for mobile navigation)

### What I learned

While working on this project, I practiced structuring a fully responsive layout using CSS Grid and Flexbox. I also implemented a JavaScript-powered mobile navigation toggle that enhances usability on smaller devices.

Hereâ€™s a small example of the navigation toggle logic:

```js
const navToggle = document.querySelector('.nav-toggle');
const navLinks = document.querySelector('.nav-links');

navToggle.addEventListener('click', () => {
  navLinks.classList.toggle('active');
});
```
